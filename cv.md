### About myself:
I am 26. My goal is to become a confident developer, to work with interesting projects and to get new knowledge.

I have been working as a constructor  engineer at the  RSC "Progress" for 3 years.

I am persistent and highly motivated.

Programming became one of my main hobbies a year ago. I started to learn ะก# by myself. I wrote several easy studying programmes. You can find them in my GitHub profile. 

I got into Front-End not so long ago and I started to learn JavaScript.

### Skills:

For example here is one of my first programm in JavaScript. It solves factorial at the range of 0 - 12/
```
function factorial(n)
{
  if (n == 0)
    {
      return 1;
    }
  else if ( n > 0 && n <= 12)
    {
      return n * factorial(n-1)
    }
  else 
    {
     throw new RangeError();
    }
}
```
### Education:
